# DOOM for the SNES — Super FX 2 (GSU-2): 4MB sd2snes & Ares version

SNES **DOOM** rebuilt from the 1995 [`DOOM-FX`](https://github.com/RandalLinden/DOOM-FX)
source (Randy Linden's "Reality Engine") with [`asar`](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar).
It adds the content and fixes of *The Ultimate DOOM* cartridge (FX3) but stays
on a **Super FX 2**, and the same engine builds DOOM II, TNT: Evilution,
Plutonia and the shareware DOOM from their WADs.

> **The ROMs use the 8 MB map** of `GSU_4MB_LAYOUT_SPEC.md`: 4 MB the Super
> FX can read (two 2 MB windows). They run on **ares** and the **sd2snes /
> FXPak Pro**; they are not known to run on real Super FX 2 hardware or on
> MiSTer, which wrap at 2 MB.

> **No game data is included.** The build makes it from your own FX3
> *The Ultimate DOOM* cartridge dump and your WADs. The repository only holds
> retouched menu art (`tools/menus/`), the shareware title picture
> (`tools/title/`) and reworked skies (`tools/skies/`).

## Building a ROM

You need:

- [`asar` 1.91](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar)
- Python 3.8+ with Pillow, numpy and scipy
- [ZokumBSP](https://github.com/zokum-no/zokumbsp) (commit `22af6de`) on the
  PATH, or `ZOKUMBSP=<path>`
- your FX3 cartridge dump `THE ULTIMATE DOOM.sfc`, The Ultimate DOOM's
  `DOOM.WAD` (v1.9), and the WAD of each other game you want

Make the data set once, then one command per game:

```sh
make data FX3="THE ULTIMATE DOOM.sfc" WAD=DOOM.WAD   # once: gamedata-fx3/

make doomfx    WAD=DOOM.WAD        # -> roms/DOOM-FX.sfc
make doom2     WAD=DOOM2.WAD       # -> roms/DOOM2-FX.sfc
make tnt       WAD=TNT.WAD         # -> roms/TNT-FX.sfc
make plutonia  WAD=PLUTONIA.WAD    # -> roms/PLUTONIA-FX.sfc
make shareware WAD=DOOM1.WAD       # -> roms/DOOM1-SHAREWARE-FX.sfc
```

Each game is built in its own copy of the data set (`gamedata-<game>/`,
linked as `data/`), so the games do not interfere; `make` alone rebuilds the
linked one to `build/doom.sfc`. DOOM II, TNT and Plutonia take 10–15 minutes
each, DOOM-FX and the shareware game a few minutes. The steps
behind these targets, and how to convert or restore single parts, are in
[docs/TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md).

## Compared with the original 1995 SNES DOOM

* **All 36 levels** of The Ultimate DOOM (the original had 22) with Episode 4,
  its intermission and end texts, one sky per episode, and the line and
  sector specials its maps use. The DOOM-FX ROM takes the levels, walls,
  sprites, title and menus from `DOOM.WAD`.
* **The Spectre** as a dark see-through shadow.
* **The Ultimate DOOM cartridge's** controls (circle strafing, walking,
  quicker turning), title menu (New Game / Load Game), screen melt and
  rumble (LRG rumble controller; not yet tried on a real controller), and
  its cheats, entered in the pause menu (*Cheats*).
* **Save games:** three slots in battery-backed RAM.
* **As on the PC:** falling, Nightmare (respawning, fast monsters, double
  ammo), a start screen like the PC's start-up log, joypad plus mouse.
* **Music** converted from each game's WAD.
* **Faster** renderer (*Engine limits and speed*).

### Fixes

Compared with the two cartridges:

* From The Ultimate DOOM cartridge, which fixed these in the original: using
  an already-used line goes on to the next line in reach (the original said
  "oof"); a sector whose floor type changes loses its old type; projectiles
  leave from half the monster's height (the Cyberdemon's rockets came out of
  its knees); a sound effect is no longer lost while the music driver is busy.
* On both cartridges: the player gets less hung up on walls (door frames,
  steps): a blocked move is tried along X only and Y only, as the PC's
  "stairstep" does.
* On the original cartridge: impassible windows and fences block the player
  from both sides; every monster of a level is created (the original had 100
  slots, its own levels need up to 162); a Cyberdemon killed outside E2M8 no
  longer writes a stray value to RAM.
* Changed from The Ultimate DOOM cartridge: E4M6 and E4M8 go on after the
  boss dies, as on the PC (the tagged doors open, the floor lowers).

## Cheats

The three cheats of The Ultimate DOOM cartridge, with its button sequences,
entered in the pause menu: they do nothing while playing, and take effect
when the game goes on. Press each button on its own; a wrong one starts that
cheat over.

| Buttons | Cheat |
|---|---|
| R, A, Down ×5, A, L | full ammo, every weapon and key, 200% armor, at least 100% health |
| L, Right, Right, Down ×5, Left, Left, Down ×4 | invulnerability for 60 seconds |
| Right, Right, Down, Down, Left ×4, twice | the whole map and the monsters on it, for this level |

## DOOM II, TNT and Plutonia

* The maps in one sequence: New Game → skill → MAP01, secret levels, level
  names, the three skies and MAP30's ending as on the PC.
* All DOOM II monsters and the super shotgun:

  | Thing | Here | Differs from the PC |
  |---|---|---|
  | Chaingunner | 4-shot burst | does not fire continuously |
  | Wolfenstein SS | as on the PC | |
  | Hell knight | claw or fireball | 600 HP (PC 500), scaled like the SNES Baron |
  | Arachnotron | 4 plasma bolts | does not fire continuously |
  | Mancubus | 3 volleys of 2 fireballs | volley pattern |
  | Revenant | punch or missile | missile does not home, no smoke |
  | Pain elemental | spits lost souls | no souls on death, no 20-soul limit |
  | Arch-vile | flame attack, raises the dead | no blast lift; heals with its attack frames |
  | Commander Keen | hangs from the ceiling | |
  | Boss brain, shooter | monsters appear at random spots; killing it ends the game | no cubes |

* Walls, sprites, weapons, sounds, title, intermission picture and music from
  the WAD; grates, bars and windows drawn see-through. TNT's three skies and
  Plutonia's SKY2 are reworked pictures (`tools/skies/`).
* Maps left out, because each needs more than the engine allows:

  | Game | Left out | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | TNT (20 of 32 maps) | MAP09, 16, 18, 19, 22, 31 | over 255 sectors |
  | | MAP20, 21, 27, 29, 31 | level RAM image over 43 KB |
  | | MAP23, 30 | map data over one 64 KB bank |
  | Plutonia (29 of 32 maps) | MAP23 | map data over one 64 KB bank |
  | | MAP28, 29 | level RAM image over 43 KB |

## Shareware DOOM

Episode 1 (E1M1–E1M9) from the shareware `DOOM1.WAD`: maps, walls, sprites,
weapons, sounds, music and the order screen from the WAD; the title is
`tools/title/TITLE.png`. Episodes 2–4 in the menu show the order screen. It
needs only 1.5 MB of the 8 MB file. The shareware licence allows passing on
`DOOM1.WAD` unchanged only: a ROM built from it is for your own use.

## Cartridge and memory map

The ROM file is **8 MB** (map `$20`, type `$15`: Super FX + RAM + battery,
128 KB GSU RAM), laid out as `GSU_4MB_LAYOUT_SPEC.md` describes:

| file offset | CPU | GSU | contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$000000-$1FFFFF` | `$00-$3F:8000` | `$00-$3F` | **window A**: code, walls and sprites, colour maps, sector data, music, menus, pictures, weapons, status bar |
| `$200000-$3FFFFF` | – | – | unused (`$FF`) |
| `$400000-$5FFFFF` | – | `$40-$5F` | **window B**: the map data the GSU reads (BSP, areas, vertexes, segs), level RAM images, tables |
| `$600000-$7FFFFF` | – | – | unused (`$FF`) |

ares and the stock sd2snes / FXPak Pro Super FX core map the file this way.
`tools/mesence-doomfx.patch` adds the map to MesenCE; `tools/aresrun` runs a
ROM in ares and can check every ROM read against the map.

## Engine limits and speed

* Per map: 255 sectors, 1664 BSP nodes and areas, 180 fixed and up to 300
  moving objects, map data in one 64 KB bank, a 43 KB level RAM image.
* Per frame: 127 visible sectors; lists that would overflow leave the rest
  out for that frame instead of hanging.

| level | fps (MesenCE, real Super FX clock) |
|---|---|
| E1M1 | 17.8 |
| E3M5 | 17.5 |
| E4M2 | 11.2 |
| E4M8 | 10.9 |

The frame rate is capped at 20 fps.
